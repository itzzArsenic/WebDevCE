        <p>
            It was kind of a lame birthday though. I kinda just stayed at home all day at ate cake. But I got a lot of free money (and cake)
            so I can't really complain.
            <br>

            Always fun lighting things on fire.
            <br>
            Speaking of lighting things on fire, we almost set the very dry field behind my Aunt's house on fire with fireworks.
            <br>
            Good times.

        Doubles Tennis Tourny
       </h3>

       <p>
        Our team went to a doubles tourny with a buncha different schools.
        <br>
        I *really* bloodied myself up during it. I don't think anyone dives for balls as much as I do.
        <br>
        We won though, so I guess it was worth it.

        Easter

       <p>
        Nothing much to say.
        <br>
        I'm pretty sure it rained or smth so litterally nothing happened.
        <br>
        Oh well.

        I don't actually remember if it gets out in May or June. But who cares? Freedom is here and thats all that matters.
        <br>
        I mostly just played videogames and tennis. Oh and worked. I can't really complain.
